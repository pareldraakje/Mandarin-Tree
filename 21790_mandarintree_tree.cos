** INSTALL SCRIPTS
**
** This script creates a tree.

scrp 2 4 21790 10
	inst
* Attributes: Can be clicked/hit. If there's fruit, it drops.
	attr 4
* Behaviour: Can be pushed (1) and hit (8). 
* Hitting the plant can make it drop fruit.
* It also suffers collisions (64).
	bhvr 73
* Set the permeability to 100, it won't fall through anything.
	perm 100
* Set the life variables: maximum lifespan and current life.
	setv ov00 rand 60 90
	setv ov01 0
* Set the tree mirroring
	setv ov02 rand 0 1
* Set the initial tick - 35 seconds
* This will reset to a smaller value once the tree is fully grown.
	tick 700

* Set the base leaf graphics to use according to the season
	doif sean lt 2
		base 0
	else
		base 4
	endi
	pose 0

* Randomly mirror the tree
	mira ov02
	slow
endm

** This script creates fruit.
scrp 2 8 21790 10
	inst
* Attributes: Can be picked up by the mouse (2).
* It also suffers collisions (64) and physics (128).
	attr 194
* Behaviour: can be eaten (16) and picked up (32).
	bhvr 48
* Permiability: Set to 90, shouldn't be dropping through many floors.
	perm 90
* Physics: Normal physics I guess
	accg 1.9
	elas 30
	fric 85
	aero 1
* Set the life variables: maximum and current life.
	setv ov00 rand 12 18
	setv ov01 0
	seta ov05 null
* Set the tick - 15 seconds
	tick 300
	slow
endm

** This script creates a flower.
scrp 2 7 21790 10
* Attributes: Suffers collisions (64). Physics will be added later, when it drops from the tree.
	attr 64
* Behaviour: can be eaten (16) and picked up (32).
	bhvr 48
* Permiability: Set to 90, shouldn't be dropping through many floors.
	perm 90
* Set the life variables: maximum and current life.
	setv ov00 rand 8 10

** TIMER SCRIPTS
**

** The tree timer script
** This script makes the tree grow and spawn fruit.
scrp 2 4 21790 9

* Check if the season base is correct
	setv va00 pose
	doif sean eq 0 or sean eq 3
		base 0
		pose va00
	else
		base 4
		pose va00
	endi
* Check if the tree is still growing
	doif pose lt 3
* If it is, grow! <3
		addv va00 1
		pose va00
		mira ov02
	else
* If the tree is not growing, spawn some fruit!
*** SPAWN
*** SPAWN
	endi

* Set the tick to a random value for spawning fruit - 35 seconds, or a random value between 20 and 30 seconds
	doif pose lt 3
		tick 700
	else
		tick rand 400 600
	endi
* Increase the current life variable by one
	addv ov01 1
* If life's up, die
	doif ov01 ge ov00
		kill ownr
	endi
endm

** The fruit timer script
scrp 2 8 21790 9
* Do not trigger when carried
	doif carr ne null
* Age the fruit
		addv ov01 1
* If life's up, die.
		doif ov01 ge ov00
			kill ownr
		endi
	endi
endm

** The flower timer script
scrp 2 7 21790 9
* If the flower isn't fully grown yet, grow
	doif pose lt 3
		setv va00 pose
		addv va00 1
		pose va00
	else
* Do not trigger when carried
		doif carr ne null
* Age the flower
			addv ov01 1
* If the life force is up, check if you're hanging on a tree.
* If you're not hanging at a tree, die
			doif ov05 eq null
				doif ov01 ge ov00
					kill ownr
				endi
			else
* If you belong to a tree, either grow into fruit or fall off.
* The chance of growing into fruit is 3/4 in summer and fall, and 1/3 in winter and spring.
				doif sean eq 0 or sean eq 3
					setv va00 rand 1 4
					doif va00 gt 1

					doif va00 gt 2
						setv va01 1

* Case: The flower falls off without turning into fruit
				doif va01 ne 1
* First set physics so it'll start falling
					attr 192
					accg 0.5
					fric 95
					elas 0
					aero 5
* Reset life
					setv ov01 0
* Disconnect from the tree
					seta ov05 null
* Case: the flower turns into fruit
				else
* Get the xpos ypos coordinates for the new fruit + plane
					targ ownr
					setv va02 posl
					setv va03 post
					setv va04 plne
					addv va04 1
* Create a new fruit
					new: simp 2 8 21790 "mandarintree_flower_linda" 4 0 va04
* Move the fruit in place if possible
					doif tmvt va02 va03 eq 1
						mvto va02 va03
